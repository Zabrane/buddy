The focus of this repository is on the earlist version that we could
find of the interpreter portion of the A+ system distributed by 
Morgan Stanley.  In particular, it shows the buddy space management
system that was eliminated in later versions, and shows more of the
coding style used by Arthur Whitney.

Note that this version is 32-bit, and dates from 4/30/1993.
A 64-bit version was not released as open source til 3/27/2008.
